This function enables phase correct PWM output. This was suggested by the AVR
datasheet as the preferred method of PWM for motor control. The duty cycles are

N = 8, by the prescale value below.
The effective PWM frequency is given by f = (f_clock) / (510 * N) =~ 3431 Hz.

To increase forward motor speed (and/or torque), decrease PWM_LEFT or PWM_RIGHT.
To decrease forward motor speed, increase PWM_LEFT or PWM_RIGHT.

LEFT_PWM is PB3, the Blue lead on the left of the solder board.
PWM_RIGHT is PB4, the blue lead on the right of the solder board.

Due to a hardware install error, PWM right runs on inverted logic.
