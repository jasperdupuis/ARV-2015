This header file includes prototypes of what's necessary to enable wheel encoder program. 
The software is designed such that for a wheel with N holes or notches, there 
will be 2N ticks of the counter. This is because the wheel and encoder share 
the same axis and speed of rotation. Using a measured diameter of 6.5cm and 
N=6 as specified, this equates to 1.7 cm / tick.

An 8-bit variable is used as it corresponds to over 216cm of travel before overflow.
The resolution can be increased by a factor of 2 or 4 before the counters are at 
risk of overflow.

encoder_setup(); must be called by your main function.
